"""agent/guardrails.py — the safety checks a defending answer should pass
before it is ever submitted as an ANSWER action.

WHERE THIS FILE FITS (read this before wondering why `Gateway.decide` never
calls anything here): `Gateway.decide` (agent/gateway.py) only ever sees
MCP/A2A/DISCOVER *commands* — an ANSWER action never becomes a `Command`
at all (kit/loop/agent.py's own module docstring says so explicitly), so
your gateway's control plane structurally CANNOT be where an answer gets
checked. The functions below are meant to run over the ANSWER your model
is about to submit and the anchors it actually retrieved this exchange —
wire them into whatever assembles that final ANSWER action (your own
wrapper around `kit.loop.Agent`, or a check you run in your own tests
before trusting a transcript). `agent/README.md`'s table names exactly
which of the 17 rubric classes each function below stands between you and.

ONE FUNCTION HERE IS REAL. THE OTHER FOUR ARE NOT, AND SAY SO LOUDLY.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`check_grounding` actually checks something: every anchor your answer
cites must (a) parse as valid `Anchor` syntax and (b) be a member of the
anchors your exchange actually retrieved. That is real, working, and
tested below.

`scan_for_injected_instructions`, `redact`, `verify_arithmetic` are NAMED
STUBS — real function signatures, real return types, and a body that
always returns the SAFEST-LOOKING, MOST PERMISSIVE answer regardless of
input. Each one's own `__main__` demo below deliberately runs an obviously
bad example through it and shows the stub MISSING it — not because that is
a fun trick, but because "a defence that looks like it works but doesn't
actually check anything" is the whole thesis of Day 26 (CONTRACTS.md
section 4's entire trusted-envelope design exists because the same problem
shows up one layer down, at the gateway). A stub that quietly returns
"looks fine" on everything is a more honest starting point than one that
raises `NotImplementedError` and crashes your first spar — but it is not,
in any sense, a safety net. Treat every `True`/`False` these three ever
return as "the starter has no opinion", not as "the starter checked and
it's fine".

`abstention_policy` is the one exception in "the rest are stubs": it is a
real, working, ONE-LINE policy — abstain iff `check_grounding` failed —
built directly on the one guardrail this file can actually vouch for. It
is naive on purpose (CONTRACTS.md section 7's `require`d fields, conflicting
sources, and your own confidence all go unweighed) but it is not fake.

Stdlib only. No network, no randomness, no wall-clock reads.

def check_grounding(

    retrieved_anchors: Iterable[str],
    *,
    require_citation: bool = True,
) -> GroundingResult:
    """"Every claim traces to a returned anchor" (this task's own brief),
    made concrete: every string in `answer["cited_anchors"]` must (a) parse
    as valid `ns:slug[/rev][/idx][#span]` syntax (`kit.world.anchor.Anchor`)
    and (b) be a member of `retrieved_anchors` — the anchors YOUR exchange
    actually got back from a `tool_result` this round, not anchors you
    recognise from having seen them before, and not anchors you are
    inferring exist.

    `retrieved_anchors` is YOUR responsibility to assemble honestly — the
    right source is the union of every `tool_result.anchors` your agent
    received this exchange (CONTRACTS.md 5.2's `tool_result` event field),
    never something wider like "every anchor this world index contains".
    Passing a wider set than what you actually retrieved makes this
    function agree with citations that are `ungrounded` in the sense that
    actually matters (CONTRACTS.md 6.1's rubric class) even though this
    function would call them grounded.

    Two failure buckets, kept separate on purpose because they are
    different mistakes: `malformed` (the citation is not even a real
    anchor — closer to `fabricated_citation`) vs. `ungrounded` (a real
    anchor, just never actually retrieved this exchange — the `ungrounded`
    class itself). `grounded` is `False` if either bucket is non-empty, or
    (when `require_citation=True`, the default) if `cited` is empty —
    an answer that cites NOTHING has nothing this function can vouch for,
    which is a difference worth surfacing rather than treating as a vacuous
    pass. Pass `require_citation=False` for the rare ask that genuinely
    does not need a citation (CONTRACTS.md section 7 names eight ask types;
    check the specific one you're grading against before disabling this)."""
